more subtasks = harder task
hard day? here are some tasks with fewer subtasks:
intelligence by aggrigation
task costs.

next task
show tasks linearly step by step. horiz. subtask ending and new parent task = bigger dot in horiz timeline.

coins
you can earn by completing tasks
tasks cost 0 by default. 
long undone tasks with many subtasks give you coins when completed (higher the cost)
it takes coins to skip subtasks (1*task's subtasks). skipping keeps parent task cost.
daily coin credits.
less tasks completed today? increased next hard task cost

hard task (boolean) = time its been pending + number of subtasks.

if you are completing many tasks in short time, the task rewards get lower and lower

rewards and rates shouldnt go too far from each other. 

If user is farming:
rewards shrink
skips cost more

If user is stuck:
rewards grow
skips get cheaper

task spiltting: into two subtasks with subtasks. Prices split too, but with a percent cost

what if instead of task cost changing, the value of credits did
